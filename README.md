Argupedia - MSc Thesis

Argupedia aims to fix the main limitations present with current Argumentation solutions
on the web. The first set of limitations are with regards to making and countering
Arguments. Existing solutions do not facilitate arguments to be made in a guided
manner, nor do they facilitate them to be countered in a rational and consistent manner.
Argupedia solves these by using Argument Schemes to provide a set of templates to
making an argument, and Critical Questions which enable Arguments to be countered
in a rational and guided manner.

The second set of limitations are that existing solutions do not present the current
state of the Discussion and which Arguments are winning and losing. Argupedia aims
to change this by implementing Dungâ€™s notion of grounded semantics to label the state
of Discussion and determine which Arguments are IN, OUT and Undecided.
Argupedia was implemented as a web application with a React front-end, Express
and NodeJS back-end and MongoDB Atlas Database.
